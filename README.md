# DaruARG
Hello and welcome to the GitHub page for my ARG! I see that you're well-versed in GitHub and well... not much to see here except the data for the ARG. Feel free to poke around! But, I do hope you give the ARG a try from beginning to the end.

If you're wondering what all the jumbled up text is, it's actually an MD5 hashing. Supposedly it's hard to unscramble, but I've had a ton of luck on a website somewhere. If you haven't figured that part out by now, maybe you should dig around some more. You're smart! I know you got it. ;)

As for the link at the very bottom of the page regarding an Armored Core 6 database, it's kind of a test project because I'm curious about databases and how to maintain them on a public-facing... page... thing. Hopefully, y'all will be able to upload your builds and be able to test builds and whatnot.

Anyway, that's all for now and thank you for playing! Catch ya on the flip side!
