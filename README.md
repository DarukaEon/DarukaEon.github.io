# DaruARG
Hello and welcome to the GitHub page for my ARG! I see that you're well-versed in GitHub and well... not much to see here except the data for the ARG. Feel free to poke around! If you're wondering what all the jumbled up text is, it's actually an MD5 hashing. Supposedly it's hard to unscramble, but I've had a ton of luck on a website somewhere. If you haven't figured that part out by now, maybe you should dig around some more. You're smart! I know you got it. ;)

Anyway, that's all for now and thank you for playing! Catch ya on the flip side!
